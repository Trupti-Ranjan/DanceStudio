# 📖 Dance Group Website

This project is a **Dance Group Website** created during my internship. The website is designed to represent a local dance group, highlighting their performances, values, and community.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🩰 **About Us** – information about the dance group and their journey  
- ⭐ **Testimonials** – feedback and experiences shared by students and members  
- 📞 **Contact Us** – an easy way to reach the group for inquiries or enrollment  
- 🌐 **Responsive Design** – works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices

This project was built to provide the group with a simple, clean, and user-friendly online presence.
